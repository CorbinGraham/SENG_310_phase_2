    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Introduction</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>This page will discuss the design and interface of the Ambient Noise Generator website. Discussed are low-fidelity mockups that will represent the design of the website that corresponds to user requirements as well as descriptions detailing the functionality of the interface. For more information on the Ambient Noise Generators requirements, see: https://corbingraham.github.io/SENG_310_phase_1/.
    </p>
    <p>The design of our ambient noise generator website is inspired by the pre-existing site defonic which is a site that also allows users to create their own ambient soundscapes. The website itself will have a similar minimalistic design to the original but with several tweaks and functional upgrades which will be described in detail below. The layout of the site will be kept simple and easy to use with the most important functions accessible from the top right corner of the site at all times. The name of our site will appear at the center of the webpage along with our brand tagline and our logotype will be on the top left corner of the site. The color scheme of the site will include the calm cool toned sky blue and its complimentary color yellow. The fonts used are minimalist and easy to read in sans serif style. A more rounded, quirky font ‘Quinta’ will be used for the title of the site as well as the names of the sound samples while a bolded arial will be used for options headings like ‘sign up/log in’, ‘import’, ‘export’.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Requirement 1 -->
  <div class="w3-container" style="margin-top:80px" id="one">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Requirement 1</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>There should be a library of existing/premade common sound samples on the website. Initial requirements will be for 20 different sounds, drawing primarily from natural sounds (e.g. birdsong, fire, waves, etc.).</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/three.png">
    <p>Data will be collected from similar pre-existing sites like defonic of what sounds are the most clicked on and played the longest. A list of looping sounds would then be compiled based on user needs. They should be available on the front page of the site with the more popular ones at the top of the page. Sounds should be displayed as boxes with a picture and title with the picture being a symbolic representation of the sound. The sounds will be listed in descending rows of four. Each sound should have a corresponding play/pause button integrated with the image, which will operate independently of all other sounds, as well as an independently operating volume control slider for that sound which appears when the sound is played below the image. All of the sliders will start at zero, and the user adjusts accordingly.  There will also be a search bar at the top right hand corner that allows user to find the sounds they desire faster.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Requirement 2 -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="two" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Requirement 2</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>The user should be able to independently control the volume of any of the ambient sounds as well as being able to control the master volume.</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/four.png">
    <p>The volume of each of the ambient sounds can be controlled by each sound’s individual volume slider as described in requirement 1. The master volume should be a drop down slider located at the top right hand corner of the screen from a volume icon, to the left of the master play/pause button. The user can click the master volume icon to mute or when sounds are playing a slider will appear beside the volume icon for users to adjust the master volume level.
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="images/mute_unmute.png">
    <p>This is an example of the icon’s appearance when not muted versus being muted.</p>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Requirement 3 -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="three" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Requirement 3</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>The user should be able to export an audio file, likely an mp3, based on the sounds they have chosen as well as the adjustments in volume that have been made to them.</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/five.png">

    <h1 class="w3-xlarge w3-text-red"><b>Requirement 3.1</b></h1>
    <p> The user should be able to choose the length/format of the audio file that they are exporting.</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/six.png">

    <h1 class="w3-xlarge w3-text-red"><b>Requirement 3.2</b></h1>
    <p>In addition to downloading the file, the user should be able to save the parameters as a preset that they can name and reuse when the user comes back.</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/seven.png">
    <p>The export option will be displayed under an advanced options dropdown bar in the top left hand corner, to the right of the import button. Pressing the button will bring up a small menu, allowing the user to select what sounds they want to be included in the recording, the volume of each sounds as well as the duration of the recording. The recording will then be made and be available for download from the site in an mp3/mp4 format.</p>
    <p>In addition to the export option there will also be a save as preset checkbox which will also save the preset for later use. The preset will be saved using cookies.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Requirement 4 -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="four" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Requirement 4</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>Ability for a user to tweak the type of sounds that are being played.  For each sound, there can be one or more variations on that sound to add variety to the product.</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/eight.png">
    <p>Aside from the ability to individually adjust the volume of each sound sample users will also be able to select variations on the sound type using a slider that appears when the sound is played. For example the sound fire will be available as a more warm fireplace sound to a more violent bonfire sound.</p>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Requirement 5 -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="five" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Requirement 5</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p> There should be an option that allows the users to upload any sound sample that they want. The uploaded sample will have the same volume control option as all the default sound samples but will not have an intensity option. The file format will be restricted to whatever sound file is used for the samples, and the custom sounds will remain local to the computer that they are uploaded from.</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/nine.png">
    <img alt="" src="images/ten.png">
    <p>Also in the advanced options drop down bar is the import option which is available if the user is signed up to site. The function is also available at the end of the sound samples list as a clickable ‘+’ icon. This allows users to upload their own sound sample to play alongside existing sounds available. If the file is in an acceptable format it will be uploaded to the users’ existing sound library. And an icon with the filename will be created at the bottom of the list of sounds which has the same play/pause and volume functions as the other sound samples. Whatever the users uploaded will also be searchable from the search bar under the name they specified.</p>

    <h1 class="w3-xlarge w3-text-red"><b>Requirement 5.1</b></h1>
    <p>Users should have the ability to remove samples that they have uploaded.</p>
    <p>Sound samples uploaded by the user should have an additional icon to the right of the play/pause button and the volume slider. Clicking on the icon will prompt the user with a confirmation dialogue box asking the user if they would like to delete the sound sample. Accepting the confirmation box will remove the sample from the user’s library.</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/eleven.png">
  </div>

  <!-- Requirement 6 -->
  <div class="w3-container" style="margin-top:80px" id="six">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Requirement 6</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>There should be a play/pause button so that users can stop or resume playback of sound samples.</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/one.png">
    <p>The play button is positioned in the top right hand corner. It will follow the screen and keep its position at the top right hand corner of the window if a user scrolls up or down in the webpage so that users can pause or play at any time. The icon should responsively change between play and pause so that users have a visual identification that the music can be resumed or paused.</p>
